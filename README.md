# E-Invoice-Design-using-XSLT---part1-Displaying-Invoice-Lines-In-a-Table

This is a series of designing e-invoice visual from scratch via XSLT. 

* **Part 1's aim**: 
   *  Introduction to E-invoice design using XSLT transforming XML format into HTML format.
   *  There will also be two invoice lines that are put into a table.  

* **Requirements** 
  * Basic Html, Css and Xslt . You can even search up the keywords presented here in Google if you don't understand, that probably would be enough.


* **About Xml file** 
  * Invoice tags in xml are self explanatory.


Note: 
Usage of XSLT must work in websites like https://xsltfiddle.liberty-development.net/. 
You can view it as text, moreover as HTML.
I'm adding output that I obtained for you -> [output.html](output.html)
