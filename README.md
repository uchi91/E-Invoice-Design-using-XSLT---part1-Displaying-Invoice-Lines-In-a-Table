# E-Invoice-Design-using-XSLT---part1-Displaying-Invoice-Lines-In-a-Table
This is a series of designing e-invoice visual via XSLT from scratch. In part 1, there are two invoice lines that have been put into a table.


For those of you who are unfamiliar with XSLT, we use it to transform XML document into another format. This format is HTML for this case.

Part1's aim -> Introduction to E-invoice design by transforming our main elements, invoice lines, in a clean Html table.

Requirements -> basic Html, Css and Xslt keywords. You can even search up the present keywords in Google for this xslt file if you don't understand, that probably would be enough.

About Xml file -> Invoice tags in xml are self explanatory.


Note: Transformation should work in websites like https://xsltfiddle.liberty-development.net/. You can view it as text, moreover as HTML.
I'm adding output that I obtained for you -> output.html
